followup is not quite correct:
- no need to add button "Ask a question about your horoscope" (remove it)
- instead after each time horoscope is shown in chat (by /horoscope command or automatically daily horoscope)
- ... user can write in chat (even not reply, just message) and it will be as request to latest horoscope
- also in reach followup ai request include original horoscope and all requests and answers about it, so ai can understand the context and give better answer
