Main file to keep summary of the developing process.

## References

- [docs/tasks/](tasks/) — individual task files with details and investigation

## Development Steps

0. Look at "Next step" section in [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md)
1. Look at `docs/tasks/` if any new tasks appeared and add them to PLAN.md (with file name status "new"; just created tasks will be without file status)
2. Get task to implement (if exists in progress — take it to continue implementing)
3. In PLAN.md mark task as in progress
4. If not exists — create task file in `docs/tasks/`
5. In task file first need to add all information how to implement task, investigation result
6. Clear context
7. Start task implementation
8. Change task file name to mark it complete
9. Add commit id in task file
10. Remove task from PLAN.md
11. Analyze plan to create new tasks if needed
